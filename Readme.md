# Creating a new UI theme by copying the Basic Theme (for MVC UI)

In this article, we will create a new UI theme by copying the Basic Theme and make some changes to it.

###In brief, the steps are: 
 * Create a new solution
 * Copy the `.Theme.Basic` project into the solution from the Githup repo
 * Remove the Basic Theme nuget package in the `.Web` project
 * Build `.Theme.Basic` project and fix errors
 * Reference the newly added local `.Theme.Basic` project in the `.Web` project
 * Make some changes in `.Theme.Basic` project to see it in action 

Let's get into the details step by step.

##  Create a new solution

Use the `new` command of the ABP CLI to create a new project:

````shell
abp new MyTheme
````
In case if you don't have ABP CLI installed on your environment, you can install or update it using the following commands.
````shell
dotnet tool install -g Volo.Abp.Cli
dotnet tool update -g Volo.Abp.Cli
````

Now open the created solution in Visual Studio.

We need to apply migrations to create the database. 

To apply database migrations right-click to the `.DbMigrator` project and select **Set as StartUp Project**

Hit F5 to run the application.

When the database migrations successfully completed, close the debug console window.

Now right-click to the `.Web` project and select **Set as StartUp Project**

When you run the application, the index page will show up in your browser as seen below.

 ##  Copy the `.Theme.Basic` project into the solution from the Githup repo
 To create a new theme, copy the [Basic Theme Source Code](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/tree/dev/framework/src/Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Mvc.UI.Theme.Basic) into your `src` folder. 
  
  Once you get a copy of the theme in your solution, right-click on the `src` folder and select Add > Existing Project.
  ![addExistingProject](images/addExistingProject.png)
  
  In the file dialog select the `Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Mvc.UI.Theme.Basic.csproj` file and click Open button to add the project to your solution.

  ##  Remove the Basic Theme nuget package in the `.Web` project
To remove the `Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Mvc.UI.Theme.Basic` NuGet package in your `.Web` project right-click on your `.Web` project and click on `Manage Nuget Packages...`

Then click Uninstall.

  ##  Build `.Theme.Basic` project and fix errors

When you build the `.Theme.Basic` Project you will get some errors.

First, open the `Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Mvc.UI.Theme.Basic.csproj` file and delete the 4 rows as seen in the image below
 because these project references are not valid anymore.
 
  ![deleteReferences](images/deleteReferences.png)

Then, right-click on your `.Theme.Basic` project and click on `Manage Nuget Packages...`

  On the `Browse` tab, search for `Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Mvc.UI.MultiTenancy` and install it.
  
  ![installMultitenancy](images/installMultitenancy.png)
  
At the time of writing this article, this fixes the errors, but if you face other reference issues simply search for that package and install it.

Now build the `.Theme.Basic` Project again and see if everything is ok.

##  Reference the newly added local `.Theme.Basic` project in the `.Web` project

We will add a reference for the newly added `.Theme.Basic` project in the `.Web` project.

For this right-click to Dependencies on your `.Web` project and click on `Add Project Reference`

  ![addProjectReference](images/addProjectReference.png)
  
  In the opened window, select `.Theme.Basic` project and click Ok.
  
  ![addBasicTheme](images/addBasicTheme.png)
  
 ## Make some changes in `.Theme.Basic` project to see it in action 
  
 Time to make some changes.
 
 Open the layout file `Application.cshtml` file located at /Themes/Basic/Layouts folder in the `.Theme.Basic` project.
 This is the default layout which is used by the main application pages.
  
  ![layout](images/layout.png)
  
  Here we can see that the layout composed of some ViewComponents. 
  
  Let's add some text next to the branding name located at the main navbar.
  
To achieve this open the `Default.cshtml` file located at /Themes/Basic/Components/Brand folder. 
And add `Hi! There` after `@BrandingProvider.AppName`, and run the `.Web` project.
  
  ![hiThere](images/hiThere.png)
  
  üèÜAnd Voila! here is the result.
  
  Now, we have our own copy of the Basic Theme and can do whatever we want.
  
  ![result](images/result.png)
  
  From now on it is up to your imagination.
  
  You can modify the theme, add your custom css/js files, or your custom ViewComponents, etc.
